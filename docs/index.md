<lottie src="static/logo.json" loop="false" buttons="false" background="none" />


Lottie is a JSON based format for animated vector graphics.

This manual contains formal specification and documentation for the Lottie format.

## Status of this manual

The Lottie specification is still a work in progress, this document
contains a subset of features that have been approved by the
Lottie Animation Community. The documentation and specs will be expanded
as more of the lottie format becomes standardized.

Once the draft is complete, there will be an announcement by the
Lottie Animation Community.
